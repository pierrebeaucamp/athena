I had the opportunity to give a talk about **Rocket** during a CoreOS Meetup in Munich.

I'm a huge fan of CoreOS and of microservices in general. But for various reasons, Docker was never as appealing to me. Thus, I was very happy when Rocket was announced and I started sending a few pull requests over.

My presentation was an introduction to this new container runtime. So it is aimed to cover just the most fundamental parts of it.
