Personal financal management is the act of managing one's own monetary
resources. This includes, but is not limited to, savings, investments,
insurances, loans, bills, and taxes. Financial literacy is a mostly overlooked
part of general [education](/wiki/education), however various countries are
starting to understand the importance of financial knowledge (See for example
the Financial Literacy Month).
