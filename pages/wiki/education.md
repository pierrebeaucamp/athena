Education is the [human right](/wiki/human-rights) to aquire knowledge. Although
as per article 26, paragraph 3 of the UDHR[^UDHR], parents have the right to
choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children, most
knowledge is aquired through government set curricula.

Building a curriculum is a very complicated task by itself, with active research
being done in the field of Curriculum Theory. Besides educational goals,
a curriculum might also be influenced by philosophical, psychological, or
sociological reasoning. However, if we try to createa curriculum from a purely
educational perspective, a set of dependencies and constraints quickly emerges.
Those constraints can be modelled as a directed acyclic graph:[^note]
