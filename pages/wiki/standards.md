title: Standards
ispage: yes
unlisted: yes
...

Standards are a form of formal documentation of a specific topic. Thanks to
standards, systems and products are interoperable and can be both implemented
and used internationally.

There are various organizations setting and managing standards, the largest of
them being the International Organization of Standardization, short ISO.
However, the ISO (and others) have a large history of controversy surrounding
their fees to access standards. Therefore the following list is only including
open-standards, which can be freely accessed and implemented.

While I'm not questioning the motives or validity of charging multiple thousands
of dollars to get access to a single families of standards, I do believe that
this practice is hindering both adoption and innovation.

# W3C

The World Wide Web Consortium was founded by Tim Berners-Lee himself and is the
main standards organization for web technology. There is a competing
organization setting a slight adoption of standards under the name of WHATWG,
but while the WHATWG is supported by the industry, it's still lacking a lot of
structure compared to the W3C. The standards can be accessed at
[www.w3.org](https://www.w3.org/standards/).
