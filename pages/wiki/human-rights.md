Human rights are the concept of universal and inalienable rights applying to all
humans. The most widely accepted standard of human rights is the Universal
Declaration of Humans Rights[^UDHR], as adopted by the United Nations General
Assembly. However each country and government is free to choose whether they
enforce human rights or not, or how they interpret the UDHR.

The following is a short summary of the UDHR:

1. All humans are born free and equal.
2. Everyone is entitled to human rights.
3. Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.
4. No one shall be held in slavery or servitude.
5. No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel treatment.
6. Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law.
7. All are equal before the law.
8. Everyone has the right to an effective remedy for acts violating human rights.
9. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.
10. Everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing by an impartial tribunal.
11. Everyone charged with an offence has the right to be presumed innocent until
proven guilty.

attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection
of the law against such interference.
13. Everyone has the right to freedom of movement. Everyone has the right to
leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.
14. Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy asylum. This right may not be
invoked in the case of prosecution arising from non-politcal crimes.
15. Everyone has the right to a nationality. No one shall be arbitrarily
deprived of this nationality nor denied the right to change nationality.

of his property.

includes freedom to manifest his belief in teaching, practice or worship.

Everyone has the right to equal pay for equal work.
24. Everyone has the right to rest and leisure.
25. Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and
well-being of himself and his family (including food, clothing, housing, etc).
Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance.
26. Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free, at least in
the elementary and fundamental stages. Elementary education shall be compulsory.

28. Everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which human

29. In the exercise of this rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only
to such limitations are solely for the purpose of securing the rights and
freedoms of others.
30. Nothing in this declaration may be interpreted as implying any right to
engage in any activity aimed at the destruction of any of the human rights.

As often with law, the articles set within the UDHR don't seem axiomatic. The
current definition doesn't seem consistent itself and most countries violate the
UDHR in one form or another.
