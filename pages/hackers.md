title: Hackers are painters

description: Paul Graham's iconic essay.
...

When I finished grad school in computer science I went to art school to
study painting. A lot of people seemed surprised that someone interested
in computers would also be interested in painting. They seemed to think
that hacking and painting were very different kinds of work-- that
hacking was cold, precise, and methodical, and that painting was the frenzied expression of some primal urge. [^intro]

Both of these images are wrong. Hacking and painting have a lot in common. In
fact, of all the different types of people I've known, hackers and painters
are among the most alike.

What hackers and painters have in common is that they're both makers. Along
with composers, architects, and writers, what hackers and painters are trying
to do is make good things. They're not doing research per se, though if in the
course of trying to make good things they discover some new technique, so much
the better. [^mn]

I've never liked the term "computer science." The main reason I don't
like it is that there's no such thing. Computer science is a grab bag of
tenuously related areas thrown together by an accident of history, like
Yugoslavia. At one end you have people who are really mathematicians, but call
what they're doing computer science so they can get DARPA grants.
[@clark1988design] In the middle you have people working on something
like the natural history of computers-- studying the behavior of
algorithms for routing data through networks, for example. And then at
the other extreme you have the hackers, who are trying to write
interesting software, and for whom computers are just a medium of
expression, as concrete is for architects or paint for painters. It's as
if mathematicians, physicists, and architects all had to be in the same
department. See [@eq:euler].

$$ e^{i\pi} - 1 = 0 $$ {#eq:euler}

Sometimes what the hackers do is called "software engineering," but this term
is just as misleading. Good software designers are no more engineers than
architects are. The border between architecture and engineering is not sharply
defined, but it's there. It falls between what and how: architects decide what
to do, and engineers figure out how to do it.

What and how should not be kept too separate. You're asking for trouble if you
try to decide what to do without understanding how to do it. But hacking can
certainly be more than just deciding how to implement some spec. At its best,
it's creating the spec-- though it turns out the best way to do that is to
implement it.

Perhaps one day "computer science" will, like Yugoslavia, get broken up into
its component parts. That might be a good thing. Especially if it meant
independence for my native land, hacking.

Bundling all these different types of work together in one department
may be convenient administratively, but it's confusing intellectually.
That's the other reason I don't like the name "computer science."
Arguably the people in the middle are doing something like an
experimental science. But the people at either end, the hackers and the
mathematicians, are not actually doing science. See [@tbl:demo].

The mathematicians don't seem bothered by this. They happily set to work
proving theorems like the other mathematicians over in the math
department, and probably soon stop noticing that the building they work in
says "computer science" on the outside. But for the hackers this label is a
problem. If what they're doing is called science, it makes them feel they
ought to be acting scientific. So instead of doing what they really want to
do, which is to design beautiful software, hackers in universities and
research labs feel they ought to be writing research papers.
