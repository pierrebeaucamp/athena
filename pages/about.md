Hi, I'm Pierre!

Thank you for stopping by at my website. I try to keep blog entries somewhat
longform, so you might be interested in my
[Twitter](https://twitter/com/pierrebeaucamp) Profile for other thoughts.

Other profiles worth checking out are
[LinkedIn](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/pierrebeaucamp),

I had the pleasure to give two talks in the past:

- * "Idris: A Language with Dependent Types" at the
  [FunctionalTO Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/FunctionalTO-meetup/events/234951625/)
  in Toronto, Canada.
- * "Introduction to Rocket" at the
  [CoreOS Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/CoreOS-Munich/events/218246822/)
  in Munich, Germany.

Lastly, if you want to reach out to me: I prefer being contacted over email,
